# Website Requirements

## Pages

- [ ] Your website should have at least three pages:
  - [x] `index.html` for regular Google Search,
  - [ ] one for Google Image Search,
  - [ ] one for Google Advanced Search.

## Navigation

- [ ] On the Google Search page, there should be links in the upper-right to go to Image Search or Advanced Search.
- [ ] On each of the other two pages, there should be a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.

## Google Search Page

- [ ] Users should be able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that query.
- [ ] Search bar should be centered with rounded corners.
- [ ] Search button should be centered beneath the search bar.

## Google Image Search Page

- [ ] Users should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that query.

## Google Advanced Search Page

- [ ] Users should be able to provide input for the following four fields:
  - [ ] Find pages with… “all these words:”
  - [ ] Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
  - [ ] Find pages with… “any of these words:”
  - [ ] Find pages with… “none of these words:”
- [ ] Options should be stacked vertically.
- [ ] All text fields should be left aligned.
- [ ] The “Advanced Search” button should be blue with white text.
- [ ] When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user should be taken to the search results page for their given query.

## I’m Feeling Lucky Button

- [ ] Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page.
- [ ] Clicking this button should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
- [ ] You may encounter a redirect notice when using the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. This is an expected consequence of a security feature implemented by Google.

## CSS

- [ ] CSS should resemble Google’s own aesthetics.
